## Type annotations

We(developers) tell Typescript the type

### When to use:

When a function returns the 'any' type and we need to clarify the value
When we declare a variable on one line then initialize it later
When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred

## Type inference

Typescript guesses the type

### When to use

Always!
